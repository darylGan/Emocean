## About the Dashboard
### Malaysiaâ€™s Floods of December 2021: Can Future Disasters be Avoided?
The floods of December 2021 in Malaysia left almost 50 dead, required the evacuation of about 400,000 people, and resulted in an overall estimate of RM6.1 billion in financial losses. Unprecedented volumes of rainfall left areas on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia under almost four meters of water and turned roads into rivers.

## Objectives
1. To identify sentiment and emotion by using supervised machine learning algorithms.
   + What algorithms can identify sentiment and emotion from tweets?
2. To develop a sentiment and emotion-based flood detection model for English and Malay.
   + How to develop a machine learning model for different languages?
3. To evaluate the effectiveness of the flood detection model by using evaluation metrics.
   + What metrics can evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning model?
4. To build a sentiment and emotion-based flood detection dashboard.
   + How can stakeholders be informed about the data insights and the use of the model?

## Stakeholders
+ General Public who are concerned about floods
+ Non-Profit Emergency Response Organizations (Mercy Malaysia; CREST Malaysia; Malaysian Red Crescent Society)
+ Governmental Bodies (NADMA; Ministry Of Natural Resources, Environment And Climate Change)
