    <h2 style="font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:#216fdb;text-align:left;">Sentiment & Emotion Flood Detection through Twitter</h2>
    
    This project was aimed to build a sentiment & emotion text analyzer about floods. 
    The dashboard can analyze how Malaysians react to the annual floods and what are their emotions. 
    
    <br/>
    <h2 style="font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:#216fdb;text-align:left;">Objectives</h2>

    1. To identify sentiment and emotion by using supervised machine learning algorithms.
        - What algorithms can identify sentiment and emotion from tweets?
        
        <br/>

    2.  To develop a sentiment and emotion-based flood detection model for English and Malay.
        - How to develop a machine learning model for different languages?
        
        <br/>
        
    3.  To evaluate the effectiveness of the flood detection model by using evaluation metrics.
        - What metrics can evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning model?
        
        <br/>

    4.  To build a sentiment and emotion-based flood detection dashboard.
        - How can stakeholders be informed about the data insights and the use of the model?
    
    <br/>
    <h2 style="font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:#216fdb;text-align:left;">Stakeholders</h2>

    The target users include:
    + General Public who are concerned about floods
    + Emergency Response Non-Profit Organizations (Mercy Malaysia; CREST Malaysia; Malaysian Red Crescent Society) 
    + Governmental Bodies (NADMA; Ministry Of Natural Resources, Environment And Climate Change)
    
    <br/>
    <h2 style="font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:#216fdb;text-align:left;">Dataset</h2>

    The datasets used in this project is scraped from Twitter using Twitter API.
